Thanks for installing amCoder!


How to activate
===============

Activate the UI theme and color scheme by modifying your user preferences file, which you can find using the menu item `Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Settings - User` (âŒ˜+, on Mac).

*Note: Don't forget to restart Sublime Text after activating the theme.*


Example settings
----------------

{
  "theme": "amCoder.sublime-theme"
}

Extra Color-Scheme
------------------

You would like this low-profile version of monokai if you think the original monokai is too shiny:

{
  "color_scheme": "Packages/Theme - amCoder/Monokai Low-Profile.tmTheme"
}


*Note: Don't forget to restart Sublime Text after activating the theme.*
